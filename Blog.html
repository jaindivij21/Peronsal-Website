                <p>On the surface, travel is about seeing new places. But underneath it is so much more, opening your horizons to experience completely different cultures, cuisines and landscapes. While photos are proof that you went and saw, it’s the transformation
                    that takes place within that is often the strongest evidence of why travel is important.
                </p>
                <p>When you travel you step into a completely new world that may be well out of your comfort zone. Perhaps you’ve never traveled alone before or being around people other than your close family and friends makes you feel intimidated. But
                    once you take the plunge, you’ll probably be surprised at the transformation that takes place. Chances are you’ll find a confidence you never knew you had and be able to take on challenges you never would have tackled previously.</p>
                <p>If you’ve grown up with all the comforts of the modern world and had the opportunity to go to school or even university, it’s easy to forget that this isn’t the case for everyone in the world. Traveling to other countries, particularly
                    those in the developing world, can be a big wake up call and put your own life in perspective. Things that you may take for granted, like having running hot water, modern appliances and the opportunity to study and get a well-paid
                    job at the end of it are not available to everyone, purely because of where they were born.You’ll probably come away with a new appreciation for everything you have and the opportunities that life throws your way.
                </p>
                <p>One of the best things about travel is undoubtedly the friendships and connections you make with people from across the globe. You might be surprised at just how close you can come to people within a matter of hours if you’re thrown together
                    by circumstance in a country that is home to neither of you. Volunteer placements are a great way to establish firm friendships as you work towards a common goal, not only with other travelers, but also the local community. The interactions
                    you’ll have will provide an incredible local insight into cultural traditions, beliefs and way of life on a communal level – something that you just can’t experience on TV or in a text book.
                </p>
                <p>If you’ve ever been awe-struck by a photograph of a landscape somewhere exotic, then just imagine how you would feel standing within it! Travel gives you the opportunity to trek, bike, raft and drive through incredible landscapes, uncovering
                    places you never believed existed, and not only view them with your own eyes, but soak up the indescribable feelings that come with standing amidst places of natural beauty. You can scan travel brochures and the internet for photos
                    of the most beautiful places across the world, but nothing equals actually experiencing them first hand.

                    <p class="padding1">This land of many cultures and languages needs no introduction! Famous the world over for its varied and exotic experiences, India has many more to offer than is possible to see in a single lifetime. From snow-capped hills to golden
                        beaches, ancient heritage architecture to glitzy skyscrapers, forested wildlife reserves to crystal clear lakes, mighty volcanoes to barren deserts, farm-striped villages to noisy urban centers, this country has a plethora of experiences
                        to offer. Goa, Rajasthan, Himachal, Kerala, and Delhi are some of its most famous cities that draw people here from the farthest corners of the world.

                    <p class="padding1 ">Often when people think of Indonesia, all that comes to mind is Bali. Comprising of over 17,000 islands, there’s so much more to the country. Indonesia is home to more than 20% of the world’s coral reefs. There are many opportunities
                        available for snorkeling and scuba diving for both beginner and experienced divers. Dating back to the 9th century, Borobudur – the largest Buddhist temple in the world is found in Java. One of the best times to visit the temple
                        is early in the morning when you can catch the sunrise while standing at the top. The mix of spirituality and adventure make Indonesia one of the top countries to visit in 2020.</p>
